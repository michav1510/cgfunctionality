/**
    Purpose: To represent a convex hull of 2d points. It is a list with the vertices of a convex hull of 2d points. I 
    implemented it using a double linked cyclic list in order to read the points in clockwise order and counterclockwise
    order. The iterator I implemented is an iterator that keep the encapsulation and you can't change the list from the 
    iterator. The push(T elem) will add the (elem) into the list and at the right position if it is not interior to the
    current convex hull. So this class provide a unified way to read the points and to add a point keeping in mind that
    this list would represent a convex hul of 2d points, i.e you can't add a point to the list which is not a vertex of
    the convex hull.
